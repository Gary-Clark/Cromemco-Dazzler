# Cromemco-Dazzler

Gerbers for the Cromemco Dazzler boards

This repositry contains two archives containing Gerber files for a replica of the Cromemco Dazzler S100 video card. 

Revision C

This will require the original vintage components to construct.

PCB artwork was created by Hugo Holden of the Vintage Computer Federation and the PCB layout created by myself, Gary Clark of the North West Computer Museum, leigh Near Manchester, England.

See Vintage computer federation website for progress in testing. Dazzler now shown to be working but without colour at present.

Kicad PCB's updated with minor errors found now corrected.

NOTE - this is not a simple build and will probably require original vintage IC's to ensure timing is correct. 
Should also be noted that memory cards must comply with the DMA requirements of the Dazzler (see VCFED thread for info)
