# Cromemco-Dazzler

Gerbers & PCB layout for the Cromemco Dazzler boards

This repositry contains two archives containing Gerber files for a replica of the Cromemco Dazzler S100 video card.

PCB artwork was created by Hugo Holden of the Vintage Computer Federation and the PCB layout created by myself.

These have not yet been tested.
